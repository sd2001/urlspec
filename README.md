**URLSpec** is a lightweight and efficient tool designed for managing and specifying URL routing patterns, optimized for high-performance web services. Built with **FastAPI**, it supports seamless URL mapping, caching with Redis, and persistence using SQLite. The application is structured to simplify the development and deployment of shortened routing mechanisms.

## Core Components

### 1. **Routers**
- Handles the primary URL management logic.
- Provides endpoints for:
  - Adding new URL routes.
  - Fetching existing routes and redirecting them back
  - Analytics for each and every shortened urls
- Includes validation for route specifications to ensure compatibility with FastAPIâ€™s standards.

### 2. **Redis Integration**
- Implements caching for faster retrieval of frequently accessed routes.
- Reduces writer-database load and improves overall performance.

### 3. **Exception Handling**
- Configured for handling invalid URLs and expired urls
